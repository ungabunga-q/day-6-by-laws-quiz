    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm & Friendly -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as an interactive quiz or flashcard system. The 100 questions from the source have been consolidated into 4 main topics for a simpler user entry point. Clicking a topic starts a quiz for that specific section, presenting one question at a time. This structure was chosen to break down the large amount of information into manageable chunks, preventing overwhelm and facilitating focused learning, which is ideal for memorization and practice. The user flow is simple: select topic -> answer questions one-by-one -> complete topic -> choose another. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The source material is a Q&A list. The best way to represent this interactively is a flashcard system. Goal: Learn & Memorize -> Presentation: One question at a time on a "card" -> Interaction: User clicks a button to reveal the answer, then another to proceed to the next question. This encourages active recall. A progress indicator helps the user track their position within a topic. Justification: This method directly converts the static quiz into an engaging learning tool, perfectly suited for the target audience. Library/Method: Vanilla JavaScript manages the quiz state, question display, and all interactions. HTML/Tailwind CSS is used for the responsive layout and styling. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
